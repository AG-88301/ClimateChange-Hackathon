# Climate Change - CO2 Emissions Map
## Current Features
* ### View Population over the years
* ### View CO2 emissions over the years
## Features which could be added
* ### Emissions just in UK cities (zoom in)
* ### Hover annotations
    - When mouse cursor over polygon create annotation box with info such as population, Co2 in numerical form
* Faster loading times
    - Currently having to retrieve all country data from .json file and using a threadpool to plot all countries. Could use procedural loading so all loaded countries are visible rather than having lag spikes
* More catgories of data e.g. GDP
    - Getting a better .json file or finding a suitable API
